# Tensor++

### 1. Introduction
This is a community driven project and developed collaboratively under **Crystal, a programming community**, which provides `Tensor` manipulation functionality in modern C++. The design goals of this project are:

1. Designing a `tensor` API similar to that of `torch` or `Tensorflow`
2. Clean API: "Easy to use, hard to misuse"
3. Extendability: Ability to add custom functionality or extending available ones
4. Performance: Quality code generation on varity of platforms and environments
